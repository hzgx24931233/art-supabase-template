# Shared Component Placement

Shared components are organized by responsibility, not by the page that first needs them. Search the closest existing category before adding a directory, and do not use `layouts` or `others` as catch-all locations.

## `core`: domain-independent UI infrastructure

| Directory | Responsibility | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core/base` | Small dependency-light display and interaction primitives | icon buttons, copy text, badges |
| `core/forms` | Inputs, selectors, form composition, and validation-aware controls | `ArtForm`, data selectors, upload controls |
| `core/feedback` | Loading, skeleton, empty, error, permission, and status feedback | `ArtAsyncState`, `ArtEmptyState`, `ArtPermissionGuard` |
| `core/surfaces` | Reusable visual containers and section chrome | `ArtSectionCard`, `ArtSectionTitle` |
| `core/layouts` | Application shell, page geometry, navigation, and structural flow | page shell, page section, menu, header, timeline |
| `core/tables` | Table rendering, querying, pagination, and table tooling | `ArtTable`, `ArtTableQuery` |
| `core/dialogs` | Generic modal containers and dialog infrastructure | `ArtDialog` |
| `core/drawers` | Generic drawer containers and drawer infrastructure | `ArtDrawer` |
| `core/media` | Image, file-preview, audio, and other media presentation | image cropper, preview controls |
| `core/charts` | Domain-independent chart wrappers | chart containers and chart primitives |
| `core/theme` | Theme-aware UI controls and visual tokens exposed as components | theme controls |
| `core/views` | Framework-level reusable view shells, not business feature pages | exception or framework view infrastructure |
| `core/widget` | Small framework widgets that do not fit a business domain | reusable utility widgets |

`core/others` is legacy only. Do not add a new component there. Move a legacy component only when it is already being materially refactored and the move can be verified without broad unrelated churn.

## `business`: shared domain-aware components

Use `src/components/business` for components reused across pages that understand business records or call exported `src/api/**` functions. They may compose `core` components but must not access transport clients directly.

Examples:

- `ArtEmployeeSelect`: tenant-scoped employee lookup and employee identity display.
- `BusinessWorkspaceHeader`: shared business workspace identity and overview metrics.
- Business record links, history, and permission-aware action surfaces.

An employee selector belongs in `business`, not `core/forms`, because it depends on the employee domain and its API contract. A generic paged table selector remains in `core/forms`.

## Page-local components

Keep a component under `src/views/<domain>/<feature>/modules` when it is only meaningful to one feature, depends on that feature's workflow state, or would expose a domain-specific API that no other page consumes.

Promote it only after a real second use or when the platform deliberately establishes a shared contract.

## Placement decision

Before creating a component, decide in this order:

1. Is it page-specific? Keep it in the feature's `modules` directory.
2. Is it shared but domain-aware or API-backed? Put it in `components/business`.
3. Is it domain-independent? Place it in the matching `components/core/<responsibility>` directory.
4. If no category fits, document the missing responsibility before adding a new top-level category. Do not default to `layouts` or `others`.

Each reusable component keeps its `README.md`, public types, usage contract, and complete loading/empty/error behavior beside the implementation.
