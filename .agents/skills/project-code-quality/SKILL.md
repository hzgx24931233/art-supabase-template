# Project Code Quality

Keep every change maintainable at repository scale, not merely functional in the edited file.

## Inspect Before Editing

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, the target module, related types, and the closest established implementation.
2. Run `git status --short`; preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Search with `rg` for existing utilities, dependencies, duplicated patterns, exports, imports, and tests before adding code.
4. Load additional domain skills required by the task. Supabase work must also use the local Supabase skill; user-facing frontend work must also use the frontend conventions and UI-quality skills.

## Keep One Clear Ownership Boundary

- Place code by technology and responsibility. Keep reusable Supabase helpers under `src/utils/supabase/`; do not scatter `supabase-*` utilities across `src/utils`.
- Keep transport logic in `src/api/**`, UI behavior in components/views, shared policy in `src/utils` or hooks, and domain-only policy beside its feature.
- Expose one canonical implementation. Remove obsolete files, duplicate local helpers, compatibility aliases, and stale imports after migrating callers.
- After changing repository structure or conventions, run `pnpm snapshot:ai` so the bundled AI project snapshot cannot recommend deleted paths or outdated rules.
- Extend the closest shared module when three or more callers need the same behavior, or when the behavior is cross-cutting policy such as error normalization.
- Do not create a wrapper that only renames an existing library or project utility.

## Preserve The Tenant-Scope Contract

Treat tenant scope as a cross-layer security and data-correctness contract, not a page filter.

- Only `isPlatformSuper` users may see or use the header tenant switcher. Tenant administrators and ordinary users never receive a cross-tenant UI or server capability.
- Ordinary users always read and write only their authenticated tenant. Ignore forged tenant-scope headers at the database boundary.
- Platform super in `全部租户` reads across tenants and retains authorized mutations. Platform super with a concrete header tenant reads and writes only that tenant unless an operation explicitly targets an existing row from the all-tenant workspace.
- For reads, use `useTenantScopeStore().effectiveTenantId` as an optional filter. `null` for platform super means all tenants; never fall back from that `null` to `getUserInfo.tenantId` or the platform tenant.
- For writes in the all-tenant workspace, derive the target from the affected row, a tenant-owned parent object, or an explicit tenant selector on create/import. Never use the authenticated platform tenant as an implicit business-data target. Do not require a header switch when the operation already has an unambiguous target tenant.
- Tenant-owned RLS tables must retain the project-wide `canonical_platform_super_write` policy (or an audited equivalent) so platform-all mutations are not rejected after the UI has resolved an explicit target. This bypass is based only on the authenticated `is_platform_super()` capability; request headers never grant it.
- Direct table reads, views, and `SECURITY DEFINER` read RPCs must implement the same ordinary/all/selected semantics. Use `app_private.current_read_tenant_id()` null-safely or `app_private.tenant_in_current_read_scope(tenant_id)`; never write `tenant_id = app_private.current_read_tenant_id()` because platform-all resolves to `NULL`.
- Authentication bootstrap is the control-plane exception: the authenticated user's own `sys_user` profile must remain readable before the shell can validate or restore a persisted tenant scope. Scope other users normally, but never attach a restrictive tenant policy that can hide `auth_user_id = auth.uid()`; verify refresh/login with a valid selected tenant and a stale invalid tenant ID.
- A platform-super bypass such as `is_platform_super() OR tenant_id = current_user_tenant_id()` is invalid for reads: it ignores a concrete header selection. Preserve permission and ownership predicates while applying the canonical tenant-read predicate.
- Verify at least four cases for tenant-sensitive work: platform-all, platform-selected, ordinary-own, and ordinary with a forged cross-tenant header. Add all-tenant create/edit coverage when the change includes mutations.

## Reuse Before Creating

Follow this order:

1. Reuse an installed focused dependency.
2. Reuse an existing project utility or core component.
3. Extend the closest shared abstraction.
4. Add a new helper only when the behavior has a distinct reusable policy.

Do not hand-write generic parsing, object, collection, date, async, observer, or formatting behavior already provided by installed dependencies.

- Use focused collection/object helpers such as `uniq`, `uniqBy`, `omit`, `get`, and `cloneDeep` instead of repeating `Set`-based de-duplication, manual property deletion, dynamic indexing, or ad-hoc deep cloning.
- When repeated display formatting has one policy, give it one named shared helper; keep domain-specific normalization beside the domain rather than in a generic UI utility.

### Main-repository ownership for cross-subrepository code

- Before adding any helper, component, composable, payload normalizer, formatter, parser, or validator in a subrepository, search the main repository and every `modules/**` repository for the same behavior and symbol.
- Generic frontend behavior used by two or more repositories belongs to the main repository. Put pure helpers under `src/utils/**`, reusable stateful behavior under `src/hooks/**`, and reusable business UI under `src/components/business/**` or the closest existing core boundary. Subrepositories must import the canonical implementation through `@/`.
- A subrepository may own only domain-specific policy or behavior that cannot be expressed without that domain's types and invariants. A local wrapper that merely renames a library or main-repository helper is not a valid ownership boundary; call or configure the shared helper directly.
- When duplication is found, migrate every repository in the same change, delete the local implementations, remove stale imports/tests, and run `pnpm reuse:audit` plus typechecks for every affected repository. Do not fix only the repository named in the immediate bug report.
- Database text normalization is explicit at the write-payload boundary. Use `normalizeNonNullableText` for `NOT NULL` text columns and `normalizeNullableText` only when blank input semantically means SQL `NULL`. Never use a global transport interceptor to guess column nullability, and never emit `.trim() || null` directly.
- Use `normalizeNullableNumber`, `normalizeStringList`, shared tenant display utilities, and shared date/currency/percent formatters instead of recreating their logic in pages or subrepositories.
- Independently deployable code is a packaging boundary, not ordinary frontend duplication. Supabase Edge Functions may share only code included in that function project's deployable `_shared` tree, and standalone module Vite bootstrap files may retain the minimal platform-root resolver required to locate the main package. Do not import main-repository source across those boundaries unless the deployment/build packaging is changed and verified in the same task.
- `pnpm reuse:audit` is the executable guard for raw nullable-text normalization, canonical-helper redeclarations, and identical generic frontend helpers copied across repositories. Fix findings by centralizing behavior; do not weaken or bypass the audit to make checks pass.

## Protect User-Facing Error Quality

- Never render or toast raw error objects, `JSON.stringify(error)`, `String(error)`, provider class names, stack traces, SQL text, or unexplained English SDK messages.
- Normalize Supabase Auth, PostgREST, Storage, and Edge Function failures in `src/utils/supabase/error.ts`.
- Branch on stable `code`, error class/name, or HTTP status before inspecting message text.
- Preserve concise Chinese business messages returned intentionally by the server. Replace unknown technical text with a workflow-specific Chinese fallback that explains the next action.
- Parse Edge Function response bodies in the API/shared boundary. Do not duplicate `normalizeFunctionInvokeError` helpers across providers.
- Keep raw errors available for diagnostics through causes, raw return fields, or controlled logs; do not expose them in the interface.
- Avoid duplicate notifications. Choose one owner—the shared response layer or the feature catch block—to display a failure.

## Enforce Semantic UI Quality

- Use native `button`, `a`, and router-link elements for actions and navigation. Do not attach actions to `div`, `span`, `li`, `p`, or `i`; ARIA roles are reserved for established composite widgets such as tabs.
- External links opened with `target="_blank"` must include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`; shared navigation helpers must enforce the same opener isolation.
- Icon-only actions require an accessible name, a visible keyboard focus state, and a tooltip or `title` when the meaning is not obvious.
- Upload controls must expose one interactive trigger. Generic attachments use `ArtUploadFile`, image previews use `ArtUploadImage`, structured spreadsheet imports use `ArtExcelImport`, and resource-library selection uses `ArtResourcePicker`. Business views must not implement raw upload lifecycles or repurpose `ArtExcelImport` for ordinary files. Do not place an `ElButton` inside `ElUpload`'s own button-like trigger; shared upload triggers use a non-interactive visual child.
- Business views must use the shared `ArtDialog` and `ArtDrawer` overlay abstractions instead of raw Element Plus overlays.
- Do not leave `console.log` or `console.debug` in business views. Use visible user feedback for demonstrations and controlled diagnostics for actionable failures.
- Never use `transition: all` or `transition-all`; enumerate the properties that actually animate. Preserve the global reduced-motion fallback.
- Give images meaningful `alt` text (or empty `alt` for decoration) and explicit intrinsic dimensions to prevent layout shift.
- Make dark mode follow the application's theme state and shared theme variables, not only the operating system's `prefers-color-scheme` value.
- Run `pnpm ui:audit` after user-facing changes. If the audit reports an existing violation, fix the shared pattern rather than weakening the rule; use an allow marker only for a correctly implemented composite ARIA widget.

## Maintain Type And Async Integrity

- Use `unknown` plus narrowing; do not introduce broad `any`, unsafe casts, or untyped state to silence errors.
- Treat database JSON, browser SDK globals, third-party callbacks, and dynamic API results as untrusted boundaries. Validate or normalize fields before returning a business DTO.
- Never use `as unknown as` in ordinary business code. If a framework or generated-client limitation makes an assertion unavoidable, keep one documented assertion in the smallest adapter boundary and expose a typed API to all callers.
- Do not tighten a non-generic shared component type by forcing every business DTO to add an index signature. Design the generic component boundary first, then migrate callers with a passing typecheck.
- Keep public functions, component exposes, emits, API payloads, and table/form records explicitly typed.
- Preserve error causes when replacing technical errors with user-facing errors.
- Pair loading changes with `finally`; prevent duplicate submissions and stale async results where relevant.
- Do not swallow unexpected failures silently. Return or throw according to the existing boundary contract.

## Refactor Completely

When consolidating code:

1. Move behavior into the canonical module.
2. Update every import and caller.
3. Delete the replaced implementation and its obsolete tests.
4. Merge meaningful test coverage into the canonical module's tests.
5. Search globally for the old symbol, path, raw pattern, and duplicate implementation.
6. Review the diff for accidental encoding, line-ending, generated-file, or unrelated changes.
7. Regenerate repository-owned derived files with their checked-in scripts; never hand-edit generated snapshots.

Do not leave parallel old/new helpers or temporary re-export files unless a documented external compatibility contract requires them.

## Verification Gate

Run focused checks before repository-wide checks:

```powershell
pnpm.cmd exec prettier --write <changed-files>
pnpm.cmd exec eslint <changed-files>
pnpm.cmd exec tsx --test <relevant-tests>
pnpm.cmd exec vue-tsc --noEmit --pretty false
```

Also:

- Run `rg` scans for the anti-pattern being removed.
- Run `pnpm ui:audit` for every user-facing change.
- Run the broader unit suite when a shared utility or API boundary changes.
- Build when module moves or exports could affect bundling.
- For user-facing changes, verify representative success, loading, empty, error, retry, and narrow-width states in a real browser.
- Report pre-existing failures separately from failures introduced by the change.

Completion requires migrated callers, deleted obsolete code, passing relevant checks, and evidence that the targeted anti-pattern no longer remains.
