# Approved UI Patterns

Use this reference when designing or improving low-cardinality choices, status fields, data tables, CRUD dialogs or drawers, and attachment workflows. 这些模式来自本项目已通过验收的界面，是首选的视觉方向。保留业务任务本身与项目组件体系，不要机械照搬示例里的标签、结构或装饰。

## Visual Character

- Keep the composition calm, light, precise, and operationally dense: white or neutral surfaces, subtle dividers, restrained theme-tinted fills, and one clear accent hierarchy.
- Prefer a small meaningful icon in a softly tinted square beside identity content. Icons support scanning; they do not replace labels or become decoration in every cell.
- Create depth through grouping, whitespace, typography, and quiet tonal contrast. Avoid heavy borders, oversized cards, strong shadows, gradients, and excessive pills.
- Keep primary actions filled and visually dominant. Use outlined or quiet treatments for secondary actions and semantic color only where it communicates meaning.

## Compact Choices And Status

- When a field has roughly two to four stable, mutually exclusive choices and seeing the alternatives improves the decision, prefer an inline segmented control or compact selectable cards over a dropdown.
- Use a segmented control for short states such as `启用 / 停用`, modes, or binary classifications. The selected segment must have an immediately perceptible fill, readable text, keyboard focus, and a non-color cue where the meaning is safety-critical.
- Keep segmented controls compact and proportional to their labels. Do not stretch a two- or three-option control across a wide dialog row; preserve intrinsic width by default, and only opt into a bounded local width when its containing field is already narrow.
- Use compact selectable cards when each choice benefits from a title, icon, or one-line explanation. Keep the cards small enough that the form still reads as a form rather than a card gallery.
- Retain a select, cascader, tree selector, or searchable business selector for long, dynamic, hierarchical, remote, or space-constrained option sets. Do not turn five or more ordinary options into a row of cramped segments.
- In `ArtForm`, reuse an existing segmented or choice-card control. If the capability is broadly missing, extend the shared form/core control instead of creating page-local markup.

## Information-Rich Tables

- Give the primary entity column a compact identity treatment: meaningful icon or file-type mark, strong title, and stable secondary metadata such as code, version, or category on a quieter line.
- Use small inline icons for genuine relationships or scope metadata such as product count, route count, attachment type, or ownership. Pair icons with text or a tooltip; do not make users decode unexplained symbols.
- Render business status as a restrained semantic tag or badge, while keeping ordinary categorical values as text unless they need emphasis.
- Use compact icon actions for familiar row operations such as view and edit, with accessible names, tooltips, visible focus, and forgiving hit areas. Put infrequent operations in the established more-actions control without hiding valid primary actions. Render row action groups through `BusinessTableRowActions`, which standardizes an 8px gap and clears legacy per-button margins; do not duplicate this spacing in feature SCSS.
- Keep column headers, row alignment, whitespace, and metadata hierarchy doing most of the visual work. Avoid adding an icon, badge, or tinted box to every cell.

## Create And Edit Overlays

- For medium or complex records, prefer a comfortably wide `ArtDialog` or `ArtDrawer` with a compact identity summary at the top, followed by tabs or clearly titled sections when the content has distinct concerns.
- Use a responsive form grid: wider fields for names and descriptions, narrower fields for version, date, sort, and status. Align labels and controls across columns; collapse cleanly at narrow desktop widths.
- Introduce a section with a concise title and one-line purpose or completeness hint when it helps the user understand what must be finished. Do not repeat obvious instructions.
- Keep the content region scrollable and the cancel/save actions stable at the bottom. Use the project's overlay and `ElScrollbar` contracts rather than page-local scrollbar behavior.
- Show current identity and status in the summary header when editing, so users can confirm which record they are changing before scanning the form.

## Attachment Area

- Treat attachments as a distinct form section near the related record fields, not as a bare file input squeezed into a grid cell.
- Use `ArtUploadFile` for generic documents. Present a clear choose/drop affordance, accepted-format and size guidance, and an in-place file list with recognizable file identity.
- Keep each file row compact and support the valid actions for the workflow, such as preview, download, replace, or remove, with accessible icon controls.
- Use a restrained dashed or tonal boundary to express the upload target. It should read as an intentional working area, not a decorative card nested inside several other cards.
- Include loading, upload progress, validation failure, empty, existing-file, permission-limited, and long-filename behavior in implementation and visual verification.

## Adaptation Rule

Apply the smallest matching pattern:

- few stable choices -> segmented control or compact choice cards;
- scannable record list -> icon-led identity cell plus restrained metadata;
- complex create/edit -> identity summary, grouped responsive form, stable footer;
- document-bearing record -> dedicated attachment section with managed file rows.

If a workflow does not match one of these shapes, use the project visual baseline and the closest polished workflow instead. A user-supplied reference for the current task always outranks this preference.
